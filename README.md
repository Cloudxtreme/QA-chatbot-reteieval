# tflearn-lstm
It's a code for chatbot(Banking Sector) like HDFC bank EVA bot. I completed only training. I also getting results. accuracy is 60%.
I also added flaskr to display results in html.
I implemente it using RNN.
If we use LSTM to implement it it very good.I also tried with LSTM.I succefully completed training,But Unable to get results.
So it's Just for Educational Purpose.
